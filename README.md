# OwnAlexa
Tried to create my own Alexa and it works..


My Alexa can do 6 tasks and more using python packages.

Initially speech recognition package has to be installed to recognise our speech.

Then python need to convert our speech to text so pyttsx3 package need to be installed.

My Alexa can play songs on youtube, to work with it pywatkit package has to be installed.
To play songs, in commands 'Play' word need to be said eg. "Alexa play xxyy".

To know about any person or something in wikipedia, wikipedia package has to be installed.
To know about anything, in commands 'need to know' sentence to be said. eg. "Alexa need to know xxyy".

And Alexa has a fun part which is it will tell jokes to work with it need to install pyjokes package.
To hear any joke eg. "Alexa tell me a joke" is the command. 'joke' word must be said in the command

INSTALL COMMANDS:

pip install speech_recognition

pip install pyttsx3

pip install pywhatkit

pip install datetime

pip install wikipedia

pip install pyjokes

This is about my alexa and in future my alexa will do much more tasks..
